Notes:

As we discussed when I asked my question after class, I had to add some additional divs
around my section tags to make the Smint plugin work.  I wouldn't have used those otherwise.

When my site loads everything is error free, but there have been a couple of times when I am
resizing my window that the Smint JS file throws an error on line 98.  It doesn't happen every 
time, and I haven't been able to get it to happen since I acutally put my site live on the web,
so maybe it had something to do with not being live. I wanted to mention it just in case 
because I can't tell what was causing it.
